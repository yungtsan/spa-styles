# spa-styles
> Global stylesheets for SPA projects with UI library (scoped component styles).

### How to use
Since UI libraries have provided scoped styles for components (and you should do so with your custom components), we only focus on global styles.

Just download the stylesheets and place them in the assets directory of your SPA project. 

Then import them in the entry of your project (mostly main.js).
